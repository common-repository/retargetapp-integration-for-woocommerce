== Description ==

Adwisely (ex-RetargetApp) combines expertise in advertising with advanced technologies to make advertising easy and efficient. With us, you don't need to invest your time and money into learning advertising best practices or experiment with campaign settings.

**Get more sales with Retargeting**

Re-engage your site visitors who didn’t make a purchase with fully automated Facebook and Instagram ads.

Bring even more sales with personalized retargeting (remarketing) ads for the cart-abandoners who are most likely to make a purchase.

**Acquire new purchasers with Prospecting**

Expand your reach by showing relevant ads to potential purchasers who haven’t visited your site yet. Prospecting ads bring a 3-5x ROAS.

**Increase average order value with Upsell**

Offer an upgraded or improved version of the product to those who added this product to the cart.

**Sell more to existing customers with Cross-Sell**

Ensure repeat purchases by showing complementary products or your best-sellers to those who have already bought something from your store.
